# Initial Explanation
In this refactored Python file, the workflow has been decomposed into atomic, reusable functions. Each function handles a single logical operation corresponding directly to the steps described in the speech transcript: navigating to the homepage, accessing the user profile (via the onboarded agent and 'Your Work' link), searching for a notebook, and finally clicking on the desired notebook. The functions include detailed docstrings and type hints for clarity, while assertions ensure preconditions such as the validity of the Page object. Using the saved authentication state from 'auth/auth.json' allows the workflow to bypass redundant login steps. The main_workflow function sequences these atomic functions with print statements preceding each step, helping trace the current URL and execution order. This structure makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

# Verification Explanation
After analyzing the output and comparing our refactored workflow to the original recorded workflow, I determined that the main issue was our use of a generic wait_for_load_state in main_workflow. In the original workflow, there isn’t an explicit wait but rather a natural progression of actions without an extra wait call. In our refactored version we already removed the wait_for_load_state from main_workflow and replaced it with a targeted wait_for_url inside click_on_your_work. In addition, URL assertions are now in place to ensure the correct page state before performing each action. The final updated version below defers to the original working steps – i.e., clicking through the elements – and waits explicitly for the URL to change from https://www.kaggle.com/ to https://www.kaggle.com/work after clicking on “Your Work”. This makes the workflow more robust while remaining as close as possible to the known-good original recording. If more waiting is needed for individual elements to load, we can later add explicit waits, but for now this matches the original workflow's approach.
