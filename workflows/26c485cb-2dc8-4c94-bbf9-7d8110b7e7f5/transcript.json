So first things first, I'm going to show you how to view your past work. So we're going to go to profile, click on your work, and as you can see, we should be able to see right here any notebooks that we were previously working on. So we can search for notebooks like this, you know, my last notebook, but instead we'll just click on this result right here and it's loading our notebook and there we can see that our code was successfully saved and we can go and run and keep working on it. Awesome.",
