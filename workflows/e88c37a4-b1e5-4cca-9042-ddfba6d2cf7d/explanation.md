# Initial Explanation
The refactored Python file is structured to provide a clean and modular approach to the automation workflow using the Playwright framework. Each function corresponds to a distinct and atomic action performed during the demonstration, ensuring modularity and reusability.

1. **Atomic Functions**: Each function is responsible for a specific action. This keeps the code organized and easy to maintain. Functions are designed to match high-level actions from the speech transcript, which allows the automation to be controlled in a logical sequence.

2. **Type Hints and Docstrings**: All functions include type hints and detailed docstrings. This improves readability and helps developers understand the purpose and usage of each function without needing to examine the implementation details.

3. **Assertions**: Assertions are added to ensure that the preconditions are met before proceeding with certain actions, like ensuring the ticker is in the correct format.

4. **Main Workflow**: The `main_workflow` function orchestrates the execution of the atomic functions. It uses print statements before each function call to track the URL state, providing insights into the page's URL before performing the next action, helping identify where things might go wrong.

5. **Use of Authenticated Context**: Instead of implementing a separate login function, the code uses a stored `storage_state` to reuse the authenticated session, speeding up the process and simplifying the workflow.

This structuring enhances the maintainability and scalability of the automation script, making it easier to update and adapt to changes in the application's UI or workflow in the future.

# Verification Explanation
The refactored script includes specific URL assertions for each function using `expect(page).to_have_url(...)`. This ensures that each function executes only when the page is on the expected URL, adding robustness to the workflow. Moreover, the function `add_variables` was modified to handle variable selection more robustly by matching specific text within the locator, which was a source of errors previously due to multiple matches.

By ensuring each function checks for the correct URL before proceeding, we can prevent actions from being executed on the wrong page. This organized approach also helps in debugging and maintaining the script as each function logs, asserts the state, and performs a single cohesive task.
