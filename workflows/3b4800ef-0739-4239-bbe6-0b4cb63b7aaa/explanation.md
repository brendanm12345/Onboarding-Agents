The refactoring was designed to create a structured and modular Python file that converts the original linear script into a set of reusable functions for improved readability and maintainability. 

1. **Atomic Functions**: Each atomic function corresponds to a distinct logical action or a related group of actions described in the speech transcript and represented in the Playwright code. For instance, actions like logging in, handling 2-factor authentication, navigating the website, searching, and querying are all isolated into individual functions.

2. **Parameters and Assertions**: Functions use parameters for inputs such as username, password, and other relevant data. Assertions ensure correct workflow states (such as verifying correct URL navigation) before actions are executed.

3. **Docstrings and Type Hints**: Each function is documented with a docstring providing a description and parameter information, thus enhancing understanding and usability. Type hints serve to clarify what types of data are expected, making the code more robust and easier to use.

4. **Error Handling**: The use of assertions and Playwright's expect features provides basic error checking and workflow stability.

5. **Main Workflow Function**: The `run_workflow` function orchestrates the entire set of actions by calling these atomic functions in sequence, demonstrating a clear, top-down view of the workflow. This makes adjustments and testing more straightforward as each part of the process is encapsulated.

Overall, the refactoring helps encourage code reuse, easier error handling, and simplifies future updates while aligning with the original flow of the demonstrated actions.
