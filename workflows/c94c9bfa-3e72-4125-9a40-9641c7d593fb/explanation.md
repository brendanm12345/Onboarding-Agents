# Initial Explanation
The refactored Python file is structured to encapsulate each primary action of the web automation workflow into individual atomic functions. This modular approach enhances code readability, reusability, and maintainability by allowing each function to handle a distinct aspect of the workflow, corresponding to a logical action described in the speech transcript.

- **Imports:** Only necessary modules from Playwright are imported to perform browser automation.

- **Atomic Functions:** Each function is designed to perform a single task, such as navigation, setting a date range, or submitting a form. This makes it easy to reuse functions for different workflows or changes in the process.

- **Type Hints and Docstrings:** Functions include type hints for clarity on parameters and returns, while docstrings describe the purpose and parameters for each function, making the code easier to understand and use.

- **Main Workflow Function:** The `main_workflow` function orchestrates the entire process, making use of the atomic functions and adding debug information to output URLs before each function call, aiding in troubleshooting and ensuring expected execution flow.

By structuring the code this way, it ensures that future changes can be easily implemented without altering the entire script, simply by modifying or updating individual functions as needed.

# Verification Explanation
The error arises because the expectation was set up to capture a change to a specific type of URL (using regex), but the page URL remained the same after the 'Submit Form' action. This indicates that either the transition to the new URL is not happening as expected or there are supposed to be other actions post form submission. In the original recording, there were interactions with the popup, which might have been overlooked here.

### Issues and Proposed Fixes
1. **URL Check Error**: The expectation for a URL change didn't match the actual behavior of the web page.
   - **Fix**: Remove the assumption of URL change and instead check for a form submission completion or specific element that indicates the process is ongoing or complete.

2. **Missing Popup Handling**: The previous implementation did not expect the correct popup triggering due to the expectation mismatch. Adjust longevity and reactiveness toward popup scenarios to align with the original workflow.
   - **Fix**: Implement waiting or expectation to confirm form submission success, or handle the popup appearance accurately without over-relying on URL changes.

Below is the revised solution:
- Focus is shifted from just waiting for URL changes to observing when the submission is completed or if a popup appears to handle any rerun appropriately.
