In the refactored Python file, I've structured the code into small, self-contained functions that each represent a specific action described in the speech transcript. Here's why I've structured it this way:

1. **Atomic Functions**: Each function performs a single, logical operation corresponding to actions a user might take on the TodoMVC app:
   - `open_todomvc`: Opens the app and navigates to a specified section.
   - `add_todo_item`: Adds an item to the to-do list.
   - `navigate_to_section`: Clicks a link to navigate between sections (All, Active, Completed).
   - `toggle_todo_item`: Toggles the checkbox to mark an item as complete.

2. **Modularity**: By breaking down tasks into functions, it becomes easier to reuse, test, and maintain them. Each function can be updated independently if needed.

3. **Assertions and Preconditions**: I've included URL assertions where applicable to ensure the app's state is as expected before performing certain actions.

4. **Documentation**: Type hints and docstrings are added to all functions for clarity, which helps in understanding what each function does, its parameters, and return types.

5. **Main Workflow**: The `main_workflow` function coordinates the sequence of actions as described in the transcript, using the atomic functions.

This structure improves code readability, maintainability, and provides a clear mapping between the userâ€™s actions and code execution, thereby making debugging and expanding the script in the future more manageable.
