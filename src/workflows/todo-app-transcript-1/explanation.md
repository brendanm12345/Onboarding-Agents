The refactoring process involves breaking down the original Playwright script into atomic, reusable functions that each handle a specific logical operation as described in the speech transcript. Here's the rationale behind structuring the file this way:

1. **Atomic Functions**: Each function corresponds to an action or piece of functionality described in the transcript. This makes each function reusable and easy to test independently. 

2. **Preconditions and Assertions**: Each function includes assertions to ensure that it operates under the correct preconditions and validates its operation. For instance, after opening the app, we assert the correct URL, and after adding an item, we check that it's visible.

3. **Function Documentation**: Each function contains a docstring that references the relevant part of the speech transcript to inform the developer about the purpose and context of the function.

4. **Parameterization**: Where applicable, functions are parameterized to increase their reusability and flexibility, such as allowing different to-do items to be added.

5. **Main Workflow Function**: The `main` function orchestrates the complete workflow using the atomic functions, providing a clear overview of the entire process. This separation of concerns enhances the readability and maintainability of the code.
