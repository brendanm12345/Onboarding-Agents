### Explanation:

- **Atomic Functions:** Each function (`open_page`, `navigate_to_data_source`, etc.) performs a single logical operation as described in the transcript, aligning with best practices in code reusability and readability.

- **Assertions:** Assertions like `assert "wrds" in page.url` ensure the appropriate preconditions are met before actions are executed.

- **Parameterization:** Functions are generalized using parameters to replace specific values, allowing for flexibility and reuse across different scenarios.

- **Playwright Context Management:** An optimal use of context management ensures that browser sessions are properly handled, reducing resource usage and potential for errors.

- **Documentation:** Docstrings provide clear documentation for the functions, detailing their purpose, parameters, and expected behavior, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain.

This setup not only improves clarity and maintainability but also sets a solid foundation for extending the code with additional features or adapting it to similar tasks in the future.
